This project was initially written for Android Target-7 (Version 2.1). It may be
already obsolete. However, it has a more updated version of the presentation

WHAT IS IT?

* It is an Android application to find Subversion Edge servers in a local network.
* It uses the same Subversion Edge Discovery API shipped with any server.
* It uses mDNS to listen to actions from servers running in a local network.
